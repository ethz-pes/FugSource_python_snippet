# Python Code Snippet for FuG Elektronik Power Source (Ethernet)

This **Python** class remote control power sources from **FuG Elektronik GmbH** over ethernet:
* connect to the device
* enable/disable the power source
* set the voltage and the current limit
* read the voltage and the current values

This class:
* works with the "FuG HYN" and "FuG HCP"
* was tested on "MS Windows" but should run with Linux
* was tested with Python 2.7 but should run with Python 3.x

This class is meant as a lightweight code to be used as a "code snippet" and not as a full package.
Power sources are dangerous and Python does not qualify as an high-integrity programming language.
External safety circuits (such as breakers) are required to guarantee the absence of hazards.
